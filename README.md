# CylinderAddons
This project adds a bunch of effects to Cylinder, some of which
are actually nice in our opinion, others are just there as a
joke. Enjoy, I guess.

## Installing
You have two options for installing this. However, you'll probably
want to install from source, so you can use new effects.

### For Cydia users
We have set up a repository that you can import with Cydia.
1. Visit https://red-chair.club/cydia/index.html.
2. Click the link. This will open Cydia and add our repository.
3. Search for CylinderAddons and install it.

### Installing from source
1. Clone this repository.
2. `cd` into the project root.
3. Run `./installer.sh i` and enter the root password when asked for.
