# CylinderAddons
This project adds a bunch of effects to Cylinder, some of which
are actually nice in our opinion, others are just there as a
joke. Enjoy, I guess.

## Installing
Eventually we might do GitHub releases, but for the time being, go ahead and build it yourself.

## Building
Run these commands as with root privileges to get a `.deb` file from the project root:
```
dpkg -b club.red-chair.cylinderaddons
dpkg -i club.red-chair.cylinderaddons.deb
```

to be continued
